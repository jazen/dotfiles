My collection of dotfiles

( Except the emacs-related ones - See http://github.com/jazen/emacs )

== 1. (Un-)Installation ==

ruby install.rb

or

ruby uninstall.rb

Essentially creates/removes some symlinks from the
dotfiles/-directories in the git repository.

== 2. Scripts ==

- zdit - a simple non-screen-clearing editor (by Christian Neukirchen)
  (Create a symlink to wherever your $PATH links to)

More to come.
